# Welcome, Bienvenue! 

I believe that it's better to share our ideas with others than to keep them to ourselves. I think some entrepreneurs would disagree with me on this because of potential IP, but oh well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a public repo so that people who want to can collaborate on any ideas they want to build. This can range from a software solution to something, some sort of hardware you want to develop, or a new start-up idea.

# Tenants
How I decide to move forward on these will rely on a set of tenets, influenced by Buster's [Book of Beliefs](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md).

- Don't reinvent the wheel - I often get stuck trying to build something from scratch when I can just reuse existing components.
- One framework - What slows me down is ramping on new tech. So decide on one framework and use that as much as possible.
- Start small - Don't try to tackle the world at once. Instead, do the bare minimum, see if it works, expands from here.
