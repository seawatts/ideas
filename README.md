# Welcome, Bienvenue! 

I believe that it's better to share our ideas with others than to keep them to ourselves. I think some entrepreneurs would disagree with me on this because of potential IP, but oh well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a public repo so that people who want to can collaborate on any ideas they want to build. This can range from a software solution to something, some sort of hardware you want to develop, or a new start-up idea.

# How it works

## Creating a new idea (GitHub Issue)

Feel free to create any new ideas you'd like. You can do so by just creating a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/seawatts/ideas/issues/new)

## Commenting on other ideas

If you have any feedback, like "this has already been done by someone else" or "here are some resources to help get started" or "I'd like to help implement this!" please feel free to comment on any existing idea (GitHub Issue)

## Internal TODO

* Add GitHub Issue templates to make it easier to create new ideas.
